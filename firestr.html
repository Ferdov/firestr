        <h2>P2P Living Software</h2>
        <br>
        A distributed way to communicate through running software. 
        Communicate and share using interactive media. 
        Provides a simple application platform for developing p2p applications
        and share these applications with others in a chat like UI.
        <br><br>
        I want this to revolutionize sharing software and teaching children how to
        program.

        <h1>Hi Joe</h1>
        Out of the box Firestr supports simple p2p text chat
        <br><br>
        On the left you see bob talking to joe. 
        <br><br>
        The communication happens only between peers. 
        A server called a greeter is used only initiate
        the p2p connection.

        <h1>Distributed Code Editing</h1>
        Firestr has a built in distributed code editor. 
        <br><br>
        You can write software with a friend and save it.
        The application runs as you code it.
        <br><br>
        Lua is the first language that is supported, but others are
        planned in the future. 
        <br><br>
        Notice that the UI is modelled after a chat program. You see
        the original chat message above the code editing message. 
        If you run another App in the session, it would appear below the
        code editor.

        <h1>Distributing Software</h1>
        Below bob sent joe his new application.
        <br><br>
        Joe liked it so much he clicked the plus on the top right and saved the application
        to his collection.
        <br><br>
        Joe can then immediately open up the code editor and make any changes he likes.
        Even if you don't write software, you can simply collect apps your friends send.
        <br><br>
        Once an App is in your collection, you can send it to others.

        The bonus is the software that is written is automatically connected. There is
        no need to worry about network programming to write software that works together
        across the network. There is a simple API to send messages that the other
        instances can capture and act upon.

        <h1>Only Beginning</h1>
        What motivated me to make Firestr? My son was born and I was not satisfied with
        the state of software development for children. I was also dissatisfied with the
        web as a telecommunication platform. 
        <br><br>
        Firestr's goal is two fold. To make distributed communication and computation
        simple, and to make it easy for children to learn software and share it with
        their friends.
        <br><br>
        And another benefit is that it works on a trust system. You never connect to 
        someone you do not know, and therefore you never infest your system with software
        that is malicious. 
        <br><br>
        My next goal for this system is to make it encrypted. I want the communication 
        to always be safe, and unencrypted communication will not be allowed.
